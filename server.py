@app.route('/', defaults={'cookies': ''})
@app.route('/<path:cookies>')
def catch_all(cookies):
    return 'Sorry! No response here. Try url again.'

# below is flask boiler plate; exclude it and stuff won't work    
if __name__=="__main__":   # Ensure this file is being run directly and not from a different module    
    app.run(debug=True)    # Run the app in debug mode.
